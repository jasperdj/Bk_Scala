# Bk_Scala
This console-based application is part of my thesis research at Atos. This application is used to benchmark performance and scalability differences between the Java and Scala version. 

My whole thesis research includes
- Bk_Scala: Scala/Akka version of the Bk use case. 
- BK_Java: Java version of the Bk use case
- IG_Scala: Scala/Akka version of the IG use case.
- IG_Java: Java version of the Bk use case. 

## Use cases
The Bk use case is a statistical component that keep track of all events happening on a website. And can return statistics on these events back.

The IG use case is a distribution component that distributes tasks among several internal web services and routes this to one of the two processing servers.
